						<i>Thank you for using Outfitter! This app was made as a clothing and outfit organizer, keeping track of what you wear so that getting ready for the day is not so hectic anymore.</i><br>

						<h2>Home / Main Menu</h2>
						<p>The main menu contains an overview of all the functionality our app has to offer: uploading and organizing your clothes, outfit planning, your low-effort digital wardrobe, and ready-to-go outfits you can make for yourself any time. Alternatively, the three-line popup menu at the top right allows you to access all of these as well as the home and help pages throughout the app. Click on whatever action you’d like to take.</p> 

						<h2>Add Clothes / Uploader</h2>
						<p>This is where you can upload your clothes, one at a time, to the wardrobe. Don’t worry about uploading them all at once -- we suggest you go as you wear! Click the “Choose File” button to upload a picture from your device, and follow your device prompts. The picture will be ready to be uploaded once its file name appears between the two buttons, and you can click “Upload” to add to it. Once the page tells you it has uploaded successfully, you can click on the link to the Wardrobe page to view it. Don’t forget to sort them: click on the drop-down menu in the middle of the page and select the type of clothing you’re uploading.</p>

						<h2>Wardrobe</h2>
						<p>The wardrobe displays all your uploaded clothing, each piece at a time (if you uploaded them right), which lets you visualize what you have in your closet without even having to step foot in it. If you want to create an outfit, or just add more photos, scroll to the bottom and you can click on the buttons that will let you do so. </p>

						<h2>Plan Outfit</h2>
						<p>This page looks virtually the same as wardrobe, but with the important difference that you can click on the images to select them for a new outfit, as well as a handy weather checker at the top. Simply type in your current city in the form box and press enter or the “Show Forecast” button to get a seven-day forecast. You can hide it again with the “Hide Forecast” button right next to it. To create a new outfit, select as many clothing images that you’d like, then click “Pick Outfit” at the bottom once you’re done, and you’ll be given the option of  either picking another outfit, or checking out the ones you’ve made on the Outfits page. If there aren’t the right clothes on there, you can always click the “Add More Clothes to Wardrobe?” button further down to add more clothes to the wardrobe.</p>

						<h2>Outfits</h2>
						<p>Here you will see all the previous outfits you’ve created. It also has the weather checker (see Plan Outfit for specifics). You can always plan more outfits by clicking “Plan Out More Outfits?” at the bottom. </p>
